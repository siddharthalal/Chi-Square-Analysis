# Problem Statement:

Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

    High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total
    Female 60 54 46 41 201
    Male 40 44 53 57 194
    Total 100 98 99 98 395
    
Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In
other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender
of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?
